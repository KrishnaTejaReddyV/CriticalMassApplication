## Work / Project Examples
- XlsxGenJs: Created a private NPM module in Node.js which can convert data in JSON format to Microsoft Excel Workbooks. The library has a class structure, as supported by the latest es6 version of JavaScript, and provides functions which can be used to add sheets, texts, tables, images and active chart objects into excel workbooks. The options defined in JSON data can also add different excel supported styles to the added elements. Based on the called functions, OOXML files are generated which together represent an excel workbook with added elements ad styles. The unique feature of this library is the ability to create active chart objects, which is not supported by any existing public NPM library. I was solely given the responsibility to learn OOXML and create this library during my internship at Inrhythm Solutions Pvt. Ltd.

- Jive: A beginner friendly Java IDE built to serve as a better tool to learn Java as compared to existing IDEs. It provides functionalities to highlight the source of runtime exceptions in the source file and elaborates the reason for exception as a text or audio message (using a speech synthesis system). It also provides an interface to run Client-Server programs in the same window, unlike existing IDEs, using Multi-Threading concepts of Java. I created this project as a part of my undergraduate coursework and was the only developer involved.The entire project is built using Apache Ant and the Jar for the application along with the project files can be found at the following link:

- TTHPL Website: A Python Flask based website to handle day to day activities of Talent Treasure Hunt Pvt. Ltd., an NGO in India. The website allows associated schools, students, interns, volunteers and business partners to register under the organisation and contains profiles for each school and student wherein they can handle all activities related to them. It also contains a ranking system to rank students of different schools based on their score in a national examination. I served as a Back-end Developer for this project and also handled few front-end modules and JavaScript animations.
